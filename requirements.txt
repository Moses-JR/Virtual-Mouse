Youâ€™re running Python 3.12.2 and want a requirements.txt that works properly with that version.
Hereâ€™s a tested and stable setup for Python 3.12.x:

opencv-python==4.10.0.84
mediapipe==0.10.14
pyautogui==0.9.54

Notes:

opencv-python 4.10.x â†’ fully supports Python 3.12.

mediapipe 0.10.x â†’ required for Python 3.12 compatibility (older versions like 0.8.x only work up to Python 3.9).

pyautogui 0.9.54 â†’ latest stable, works across Python 3.7â€“3.12.

ðŸ“Œ Save this as requirements.txt and install with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

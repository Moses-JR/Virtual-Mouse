🖱️ Virtual Mouse using Python
📌 Overview

The Virtual Mouse is a computer vision project that allows users to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures instead of a physical mouse. Using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI, it detects hand landmarks via webcam and maps gestures to mouse actions like moving the cursor, clicking, dragging, and scrolling.

This project demonstrates how AI-powered gesture recognition can create touch-free, intuitive, and futuristic human-computer interaction.

🚀 Features

✅ Cursor movement using index finger

✅ Left click (thumb + index finger gesture)

✅ Right click (thumb + middle finger gesture)

✅ Drag & Drop (thumb + ring finger gesture)

✅ Scrolling (thumbs up/down gestures)

✅ On-screen gesture instructions for user guidance

✅ Works in real time with any standard webcam

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV – real-time video processing

Mediapipe – hand and finger landmark detection

PyAutoGUI – for controlling mouse actions
